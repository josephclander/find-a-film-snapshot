## Web Application Features

`Find-a-Film` is a web application that provides an easy to use interface for
users to decide what movie to watch. It fetches from multiple data sources to
provide the user with all they need to make the best movie choice.

- Quick results from user input via the search bar
- Error messages for enhanced user experience
- Provides key information with a clean UI
- Sorting functions
- Responsive design

## Why this App was built

Eager to further our learning during the Christmas break, we created a team to
design a project. It allowed us to reinforce our knowledge in `React` and
`asynchronous data requests` as well as challenging ourselves with new skills in
`TypeScript`.

Our user problem was centered around having access to multiple streaming platforms (e.g. Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+), but feeling like it was always hard to find a good film to watch.

We wanted to solve a genuine need for the group and so `find-a-film` was decided
on based on the following considerations:

üëé Many sites provide:

- Too much information
- Clunky design

üëç This app was built by the team to create a:

- Better user experience
- Site we would be happy to use

## How the product was built

The team were distributed across the UK with varying availabilty. We managed our project with:

- An `MVP` focused to meet user stories
- User story mapping on `Miro`
- Feature tickets via `Trello`
- Team communication via `Slack`
- `Slack bots` for `GitHub Pull Requests`
